<h1>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they  arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them&mdash;all sorts of little  birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was  standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard  him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,  and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court  was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,  that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them&mdash;'I wish they'd get the  trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there  seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about  her, to pass away the time.</h1>

<h2>'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done just as well.</h2>
